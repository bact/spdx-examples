# Example 01

## Description

This example illustrates a software bill of materials (BOM) for an AI
application that employs machine learning to perform a handwritten text
recognition task.

The BOM demonstrates the structure between `AIPackage`, `DatasetPackage`, and
(software) `Package` through relationship types such as `dependsOn`,
`testedOn`, and `trainedOn`.
