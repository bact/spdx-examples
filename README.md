# SPDX Usage Examples

This repository includes demonstrations of [SPDX](https://spdx.dev) for various
scenarios and use cases.

The repository is organized by profiles which represents a set of scenarios and
use cases for a particular domain (e.g. security, license compliance).
Each directory contains a README.md file describing the profile and the
examples contained within that directory.

The [`presentations`](./presentations/) directory contains examples included in
various SPDX presentations.

Please note that this repository does not contain all of the supported fields
nor all of the supported serialization formats in the latest version of the
specification.

Additional version-specific examples can be found in the `examples` directory
of each specification version:

- [v3.0.1](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/tree/development/v3.0.1/examples)
- [v2.3.1](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/tree/development/v2.3.1/examples)

More guidance on using SPDX, including how to use SPDX license list short
identifiers in source files and leverage SPDX for compliance with standards and
regulations, is available in the [`spdx/using`](https://github.com/spdx/using/)
repository.
